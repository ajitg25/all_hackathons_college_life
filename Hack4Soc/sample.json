But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the Movie tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition\",\"genres\":[\"Young Adult\",\"Dystopia\",\"Fiction\",\"Fantasy\",\"Science Fiction\",\"Romance\",\"Adventure\",\"Teen\",\"Post Apocalyptic\",\"Action\"],\"characters\":\"['Thomas Becket', 'Henry II of England', 'Tom Builder', 'Prior Philip', 'Aliena', 'Jack Jackson', 'Stephen of England', 'Empress Matilda', 'William Hamleigh', 'Ellen', 'Richard of Kingsbridge', 'Alfred Builder', 'Waleran Bigod', 'Lord Percy Hamleigh', 'Lady Regan Hamleigh', 'Remigius']\",\"rating\":4,\"coverImg\":\"https:\\/\\/i.gr-assets.com\\/images\\/S\\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\\/books\\/1576956100l\\/5043.jpg\"},\"104\":{\"title\":\"Clockwork Angel\",\"series\":\"The Infernal Devices #1\",\"author\":\"Cassandra Clare (Goodreads Author), Rita Sussekind (Translator)\",\"description\":\"In a time when Shadowhunters are barely winning the fight against the forces of darkness, one battle will change the course of history forever.

For decades, Herriot roamed the remote, beautiful Yorkshire Dales, treating every patient that came his way from smallest to largest, and observing animals and humans alike with his keen, loving eye.In All Creatures Great and Small, we meet the young Herriot as he takes up his calling and discovers that the realities of veterinary practice in rural Yorkshire are very different from the sterile setting of veterinary school. Some visits are heart-wrenchingly difficult, such as one to an old man in the village whose very ill dog is his only friend and companion, some are lighthearted and fun, such as Herriot's periodic visits to the overfed and pampered Pekinese Tricki Woo who throws parties and has his own stationery, and yet others are inspirational and enlightening, such as Herriot's recollections of poor farmers who will scrape their meager earnings together to be able to get proper care for their working animals. From seeing to his patients in the depths of winter on the remotest homesteads to dealing with uncooperative owners and critically ill animals, Herriot discovers the wondrous variety and never-ending challenges of veterinary practice as his humor, compassion, and love of the animal world shine forth.James Herriot's memoirs have sold 80 million copies worldwide, and continue to delight and entertain readers of all ages\",\"genres\":[\"Dystopia\",\"Young Adult\",\"Romance\",\"Science Fiction\",\"Fantasy\",\"Fiction\",\"Adventure\",\"Action\",\"Audiobook\",\"Teen\"],\"characters\":\"['James Herriot', 'Siegfried Farnon', 'Tristan Farnon', 'Helen Alderson', 'Mrs. Hall', 'Mrs. Pumphrey', 'Tricky Woo', 'Granville Bennet', 'Diana Brompton', 'Herbert Jarvis', 'Broom', 'Charlie Dent', 'John Skipton', 'Copfield']\",\"rating\":4,\"coverImg\":\"https:\\/\\/i.gr-assets.com\\/images\\/S\\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\\/books\\/1393644607l\\/32085.jpg\"},\"302\":{\"title\":\"Kafka on the Shore\",\"series\":\"\\u6d77\\u8fba\\u306e\\u30ab\\u30d5\\u30ab\",\"author\":\"Haruki Murakami, Philip Gabriel (Translator)\",\"description\":\"Kafka on the Shore, a tour de force of metaphysical reality, is powered by two remarkable characters: a teenage boy, Kafka Tamura, who runs away from home either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister; and an aging simpleton called Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction and now is drawn toward Kafka for reasons that, like the most basic activities of daily life, he cannot fathom.

We're in the most extreme and utter region of the human mind. A dim, subconscious underworld. A radiant abyss where men meet themselves. Hell, Netley. We're in Hell.\\\" Having proved himself peerless in the arena of reinterpreting superheroes, Alan Moore turned his ever-incisive eye to the squalid, enigmatic world of Jack the Ripper and the Whitechapel murders of 1888. Weighing in at 576 pages, From Hell is certainly the most epic of Moore's works and remarkably and is possibly his finest effort yet in a career punctuated by such glorious highlights as Watchmen and V for Vendetta. Going beyond the myriad existing theories, which range from the sublime to the ridiculous, Moore presents an ingenious take on the slaughter. His Ripper's brutal activities are the epicentre of a conspiracy involving the very heart of the British Establishment, including the Freemasons and The Royal Family. A popular claim, which is transformed through Moore's exquisite and thoroughly gripping vision, of the Ripper crimes being the womb from which the 20th century, so enmeshed in the celebrity culture of violence, received its shocking, visceral birth. Bolstered by meticulous research that encompasses a wide spectrum of Ripper studies and myths and coupled with his ability to evoke sympathies in such monstrous characters, Moore has created perhaps the finest examination of the Ripper legacy, observing far beyond society's obsessive need to expose Evil's visage. Ultimately, as Moore observes, Jack's identity and his actions are inconsequential to the manner in which society embraced the Fear: \\\"It's about us. It's about our minds and how they dance. Jack mirrors our hysterias. Faceless, he is the receptacle for each new social panic.\\\" Eddie Campbell's stunning black and white artwork, replete with a scratchy, dirty sheen, is perfectly matched to the often-unshakeable intensity of Moore's writing. Between them, each murder is rendered in horrifying detail, providing the book's most unnerving scenes, made more so in uncomfortable, yet lyrical moments as when the villain embraces an eviscerated corpse, craving understanding; pleading that they \\\"are wed in legend, inextricable within eternity\\\". Though technically a comic, the term hardly begins to describe From Hell's inimitable grandeur and finesse, as it takes the medium to fresh heights of ingenuity and craftsmanship. Moore and Campbell's autopsy on the emaciated corpse of the Ripper myth has divulged a deeply disturbing yet undeniably captivating masterpiece. \\u2014Danny Graydon\",\"genres\":[\"Fantasy\",\"Young Adult\",\"Horror\",\"Vampires\",\"Fiction\",\"Paranormal\",\"Supernatural\",\"Adventure\",\"Urban Fantasy\",\"Middle Grade\"],\"characters\":\"['Aleister Crowley', 'Oscar Wilde', 'Jack the Ripper', 'William Morris', 'Frederick George Abberline', 'Joseph Merrick', 'Queen Victoria']\",\"rating\":4,\"coverImg\":\"https:\\/\\/i.gr-assets.com\\/images\\/S\\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\\/books\\/1509277098l\\/23529._SX318_.jpg\"},\"2014\":{\"title\":\"Silver Shadows\",\"series\":\"Bloodlines #5\",\"author\":\"Richelle Mead (Goodreads Author)\",\"description\":\"Sydney Sage is an Alchemist, one of a group of humans who dabble in magic and serve to bridge the worlds of humans and vampires.

Young Sam Gribley gets to the end of the block and keeps going--all the way to the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York. There he sets up house in a huge hollowed-out tree, with a falcon and a weasel for companions and his wits as his tool for survival. In a spellbinding, touching, funny account, Sam learns to live off the land, and grows up a little in the process. Blizzards, hunters, loneliness, and fear all battle to drive Sam back to city life. But his desire for freedom, independence, and adventure is stronger. No reader will be immune to the compulsion to go right out and start whittling fishhooks and befriending raccoons.  Jean Craighead George, author of more than 80 children's books, including the Newbery Medal-winning Julie of the Wolves, created another prizewinner with My Side of the Mountain--a Newbery Honor Book, an ALA Notable Book, and a Hans Christian Andersen Award Honor Book. Astonishingly, she wrote its sequel, On the Far Side of the Mountain, 30 years later, and a decade after that penned the final book in the trilogy, Frightful's Mountain, told from the falcon's point of view. George has no doubt shaped generations of young readers with her outdoor adventures of the mind and spirit.

Temujin's young life was shaped by a series of brutal acts: the betrayal of his father by a neighboring tribe and the abandonment of his entire family, cruelly left to die on the harsh plain. But Temujin endured--and from that moment on, he was driven by a singular fury: to survive in the face of death, to kill before being killed, and to conquer enemies who could come without warning from beyond the horizon.  Through a series of courageous raids against the Tartars, Temujin's legend grew. And so did the challenges he faced--from the machinations of a Chinese ambassador to the brutal abduction of his young wife, Borte. Blessed with ferocious courage, it was the young warrior's ability to learn, to imagine, and to judge the hearts of others that propelled him to greater and greater power.

It is the first of four connected plays--including 1 Henry IV, 2 Henry IV, and Henry V--generally considered Shakespeare's finest history plays.  The drama of Richard II centers on the power struggle between the grandiloquent King Richard and the plain-spoken, blunt Henry Bolingbroke, who is banished from Britain at the beginning of the play. But when Henry's father John of Gaunt dies, Richard confiscates his property with no regard to his son's rights, and Bolingbroke returns to confront the king, who surrenders his crown and is imprisoned in Pomfret Castle, where he is soon murdered. This new edition in the acclaimed Oxford Shakespeare series features a freshly edited version of the text. The wide-ranging introduction describes the play's historical circumstances, both the period that it dramatizes (the start of the \\\"wars of the roses\\\") and the period in which it was written (late Elizabethan England), and the play's political significance in its own time and our own. It also focuses on the play's richly poetic language and its success over the centuries as a play for the stage. Extensive explanatory notes help readers at all levels understand and appreciate the language, characters, and dramatic action and the book's lively illustrations provide a sense of the historical background and performance of the play.\",\"genres\":[\"Mystery\",\"Fiction\",\"Cozy Mystery\",\"Scotland\",\"Crime\",\"Audiobook\",\"British Literature\",\"Mystery Thriller\",\"Detective\",\"Murder Mystery\"],\"characters\":\"['Henry Percy \\\"Hotspur\\\"', 'Henry V of England', 'John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster', 'Richard II of England', 'Henry IV of England', 'Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk', 'Edward of Langley, 2nd Duke of York', 'Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey', 'Sir Henry Greene', 'Sir Edward Bagot', 'Sir William Bushy', 'William le Scrope, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, King of Mann', 'Eleanor de Bohun, Duchess of Gloucester', 'Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland', 'Edward, 2nd Duke of York, Duke of Aumerle', 'Isabella of Valois', 'Joan Holland', 'John Montagu, 3rd Earl of Salisbury', 'Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley', 'Sir Stephen Scroop', 'Thomas Merke, Bishop of Carlisle', 'William de Colchester, Abbott of Westminster', 'William de Ros, 6th Baron Ros', 'William Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby de Eresby', 'Walter FitzWalter, 4th (or 5th) Baron FitzWalter', 'Sir Piers Exton', 'Lord Marshal', 'Welsh Captain', '1st Herald', '2nd Herald', 'Gardener', \\\"1st Gardener's Man\\\", \\\"2nd Gardener's Man\\\", '1st Lady', '2nd Lady', 'Keeper of Pomfret Prison', 'Groom']\",\"rating\":3,\"coverImg\":\"https:\\/\\/i.gr-assets.com\\/images\\/S\\/compressed.photo.goodreads.com\\/books\\/1347228947l\\/82397.jpg\"},\"7997\":{\"title\":\"The Dragon Keeper\",\"series\":\"The Rain Wild Chronicles #1\",\"author\":\"Robin Hobb (Goodreads Author)\",\"description\":\"Too much time has passed since the powerful dragon Tintaglia helped the people of the Trader cities stave off an invasion of their enemies.
